# BanqApplication

This is an Android application coded in Java. It allows bank customers to verify their accounts, transfer money, and check their monetary transaction history. I use MySQL database to store users' information and transactions. Additionally, I use PHP to handle requests and store transactions in this database. The application is developed in Android Studio.
